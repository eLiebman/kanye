# Kanye Said What?
Here's a simple app that fetches and displays Kanye West Quotes from the **kanye.rest** api. Users can refresh the list, 'like' and display their favorite quotes, and sort quotes by length, ascending or descending.

## Running the App Locally
To run the app locally, clone or download the repo from
https://github.com/elgincheese/kanye.git

Navigate to the root directory, **kanye-master**
And run 
`npm install`
Followed by 
`npm start`

This will run the web server on port 3000, and open a browser tab to display the app.
